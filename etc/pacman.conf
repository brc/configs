# Old reason for not upgrading tmux:
#   I compiled tmux 2.7 from Github and backported a bugfix (GH issue #1352); see
#   `hotfix` branch in /git/tmux/tmux/. The tmux package is installed in pacman
#   db (--dbonly), but not in the fs... I copied the file into fs manually.
#
# Newest reason:
#   3.2 upgrade seemed to cause confusion; waiting to upgrade.
#   See https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2645
#
#IgnorePkg   = tmux

# Don't upgrade avr-gcc 8.x because apparently QMK needs it

# KWallet 5.97.0 is a big deal because they implemented the 
# org.freedesktop.secrets DBus API (see
# https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kwallet/-/merge_requests/11).
#
#     This entirely broke AppGate SDP because it was no longer able to
#     retrieve/store its controller CA cert in the keyring.  If you're no
#     longer using AppGate, you can probably remove this config. :-)

# By default, pacman accepts packages signed by keys that its local keyring
# trusts (see pacman-key and its man page), as well as unsigned packages.

# NOTE: You must run `pacman-key --init` before first using pacman; the local

#
# REPOSITORIES
#   - can be defined here or included from another file
#   - pacman will search repositories in the order defined here
#   - local/custom mirrors can be added here or in separate files
#   - repositories listed first will take precedence when packages
#     have identical names, regardless of version number
#   - URLs will have $repo replaced by the name of the current repo
#   - URLs will have $arch replaced by the name of the architecture
#
# Repository entries are of the format:
#       [repo-name]
#       Server = ServerName
#       Include = IncludePath
#
# The header [repo-name] is crucial - it must be present and
# uncommented to enable the repo.
#

# The testing repositories are disabled by default. To enable, uncomment the
# repo name header and Include lines. You can add preferred servers immediately
# after the header, and they will be used before the default mirrors.

#[testing]
