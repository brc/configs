! For running in VMWare Fusion:
!     - Both Command keys are mapped to Super (because it assumes Windows)
!     - Map them to Alt_L and Alt_R
!
!   remove Mod4 = Super_L Super_R
!   add Mod1 = Super_L Super_R


! Convert Super to Meta
clear mod4
remove mod1 = Meta_L
keycode 133 = Meta_L
keycode 134 = Meta_R
add mod1 = Meta_L Meta_R
